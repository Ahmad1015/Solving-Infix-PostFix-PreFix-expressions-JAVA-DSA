# Project Overview
This Java application evaluates mathematical expressions in prefix, postfix, and infix notations using stack-based data structures. It includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implemented methods.

## Features
- Prefix Evaluation: Evaluates mathematical expressions given in prefix notation.
- Postfix Evaluation: Evaluates mathematical expressions given in postfix notation.
- Infix to Postfix Conversion: Converts infix notation expressions to postfix notation.
## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JUnit 5 for running unit tests
## Unit Tests
The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the prefix, postfix, and infix evaluation methods. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases, such as division by zero and empty input.
